About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Education, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of [Prof. Yu Zhang](https://www.ioe.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1131/3622.htm). I received my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University. My research interests lie in multimodal learning analytics and its applications in AI-supported education.
